Elasticsearch tuning
========================================

This guide summarizes the relevant configurations that allow us to optimize Elasticsearch.

Memory locking
----------------------------------------

Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory. It is vitally important to the health of your node that none of the JVM is ever swapped out to disk.

We will set the *bootstrap.memory_lock* setting to true, so Elasticsearch will lock the process address space into RAM, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out.

Step 1: Set bootstrap.memory_lock
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uncomment or add this line to the ``/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`` file::

    bootstrap.memory_lock: true

Step 2: Edit limit of system resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Where to configure systems settings depends on which package you have used to install Elasticsearch, and which operating system you are using:

 - For systems using **systemd**, system limits need to be specified via systemd. First, create the folder executing the command: ``mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service.d/``; add a file called ``elasticsearch.conf``: ``cat >> /etc/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service.d/elasticsearch.conf``; add the following to that file::

    [Service]
    LimitMEMLOCK=infinity

 - For SysV Init, edit the proper file ``/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`` for RPM or ``/etc/default/elasticsearch`` for Debian::

     MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited

Step 3: Limit memory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The previous configuration might cause node instability or even node death (with an *OutOfMemory* exception) if Elasticsearch tries to allocate more memory than is available. JVM heap limits will help us limit the memory usage and prevent this situation.

There are two rules to apply when setting the Elasticsearch heap size:

  - No more than 50% of available RAM.
  - No more than 32 GB.

In addition, you must take into account the memory usage of the other software running in the host as well as the operating system.

The default installation of Elasticsearch is configured with a 1 GB heap. You can change the heap size via JVM flags using the ``/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options`` file::

    # Xms represents the initial size of total heap space
    # Xmx represents the maximum size of total heap space

    -Xms4g
    -Xmx4g

.. warning::

    Ensure that the min (Xms) and max (Xmx) sizes are the same to prevent the heap from resizing at runtime, a very costly process.

Step 4: Restart Elasticsearch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, restart Elasticsearch service:

    a) For Systemd::
	
        systemctl daemon-reload
        systemctl restart elasticsearch

    b) For SysV Init::

        service elasticsearch restart

After starting Elasticsearch, you can see whether this setting was applied successfully by checking the value of mlockall in the output from this request::

    curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_nodes?filter_path=**.mlockall&pretty'

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "nodes" : {
        "sRuGbIQRRfC54wzwIHjJWQ" : {
          "process" : {
            "mlockall" : true
          }
        }
      }
    }

If you see that mlockall is false, then it means that the mlockall request has failed. You will also see a line with more information in the logs (*/var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log*) with the words *Unable to lock JVM Memory*.
