CIS-CAT integration
===================

.. versionadded:: 3.1.0

The **CIS-CAT wodle** has been developed with the aim of running CIS benchmarks assessments into Wazuh agents.

What is CIS-CAT
---------------

CIS (Center for Internet Security) is an entity dedicated to safeguard private and public organizations against cyber threats. This entity provides
CIS benchmarks guidelines, which are a recognized global standard and best practices for securing IT systems and data against cyberattacks.

In addition, CIS-CAT pro is a "cross-platform Java app" tool developed for scanning target systems and generating a report comparing the system settings to
the CIS benchmarks. There exists more than 80 CIS benchmarks with coverage for nearly all OS, providing different profiles depending on the specific need.

We have to highlight that CIS-CAT pro is a proprietary software and it is necessary for using this integration.

How it works
------------

The CIS-CAT Wazuh module attempts to integrate CIS benchmark assessments into Wazuh agents and report results of each scan in alerts form.

CIS-CAT pro is written in Java, so it requires a Java Runtime Environment in order to execute it. Currently, the JRE versions supported in
CIS-CAT are JRE 6, 7, 8.

For running this integration, the CIS-CAT tool should reside in the local agent that runs the scans. However, the JRE can be located on
a removable disk or network drive for sharing it between multiple agents.

In addition, in Unix systems the CIS-CAT script might need to be granted execute permissions. To do this, in the CIS-CAT directory run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    # chmod +x CIS-CAT.sh

Finally, the ``xsltproc`` tool is necessary to convert CIS-CAT reports into Wazuh alerts. It is a common tool that can be easily found in any Unix distribution.

Once you have the requirements for running CIS evaluations, you can configure the wodle for evaluate specific Benchmarks with a configured
frequency, scan results after executing the checks are sent to the manager and you will be able to visualize them as you prefer.

Use case: Running a CIS evaluation
----------------------------------

In order to deploy the CIS-CAT integration, this section can be follow as example of how to use it.

1. In the configuration file, ``ossec.conf``, you have to set a section like the following one.

.. code-block:: xml

  <wodle name="cis-cat">

    <disabled>no</disabled>
    <timeout>1800</timeout>
    <interval>1d</interval>
    <scan-on-start>yes</scan-on-start>

    <java_path>/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin</java_path>
    <ciscat_path>/var/ossec/wodles/ciscat</ciscat_path>

    <content type="xccdf" path="benchmarks/CIS_Ubuntu_Linux_16.04_LTS_Benchmark_v1.0.0-xccdf.xml">
      <profile>xccdf_org.cisecurity.benchmarks_profile_Level_2_-_Server</profile>
    </content>

  </wodle>

.. note::
    Be sure that Java and CIS-CAT tool are located in the specified paths. Apart from that, the defined path of the benchmark selected has to be relative to the CIS-CAT tool.

If no profile is specified for a certain content, it will be selected the first one, which is usually the most permisive.

2. After restart the Wazuh agent, evaluations will be executed with the specified interval, triggering alerts
as shown below.
